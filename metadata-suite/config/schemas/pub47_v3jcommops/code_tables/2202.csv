code	description	definition
10	Selected	A mobile ship station equipped with sufficient certified meteorological instruments for making observations, transmits regular weather reports and enters the observations in a meteorological logbook. A Selected ship should have at least a barometer, a thermometer to measure SST, a psychrometer (for AT and humidity), a barograph and possibly an anemometer.
15	Selected (AWS)	An AWS system equipped with certified meteorological instruments to measure at least at least air pressure, pressure change, temperature and humidity. Optional sensors would include wind speed and direction and sea temperature measurement. The AWS may or may not have the facility for manual input of the visual elements, and transmit reports at least three hourly or more frequently. The AWS should have the facility to log the data.
30	VOSClim – VOS Climate	A mobile ship station equipped with sufficient certified meteorological instruments for making observations, transmits regular and timely weather reports, enters the observations in an IMMT compliant electronic logbook including the extra VOSClim delayed-mode groups, and has a proven record of providing high quality observations. The ship should have at least a barometer, a thermometer to measure SST, a psychrometer (for AT and humidity), a barograph and possibly an anemometer. The ship should be inspected at less than six month intervals.
35	VOSClim (AWS) – VOS Climate (AWS)	An AWS system equipped with certified meteorological instruments to measure at least air pressure, pressure change, temperature and humidity. Optional sensors would include wind speed and direction and sea temperature measurement. The AWS may have a facility for manual input of the visual elements, and transmit reports at least three hourly or more frequently. The AWS must have the facility to log the data including the additional IMMT delayed-mode VOSClim groups. The ship should be inspected at less than six month intervals.
40	Supplementary 	A mobile ship station equipped with a limited number of certified meteorological instruments for making observations. It transmits regular weather reports and enters the observations in a meteorological logbook.
45	Supplementary (AWS)	An AWS system equipped with a limited number of certified meteorological instruments that  reports regularly. The AWS should at least measure air pressure.
70	Auxiliary 	A mobile ship station normally without certified meteorological instruments, which transmits in a reduced code form or in plain language, either on a routine basis or on request, in certain areas and under certain conditions.
75	Auxiliary (AWS)	An AWS system using non-certified meteorological instruments and reporting regularly. The AWS should at least measure air pressure.
80	Third Party Support	A mobile ship station, normally without certified meteorological instruments, which is not recruited to a Members national fleet but is recruited under country code ZZ (Table 1801).
85	Third Party Support (AWS)	An AWS system, normally using non-certified meteorological instruments, which is not recruited to a Members national fleet but is recruited under country code ZZ (Table 1801).
101	Other (specify in footnote).
