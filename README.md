# glamod-marine-processing-v1.3

Repository containing suite of python scripts used to perform processing of marine observations. Even older versions can be found in glamod-marine-processing-old.

Resolving the merge conflics would require considerable care with unclear benefits. This is kept as arcive since it has been used for processing, for its history record and because it might contain useful nuggets.
